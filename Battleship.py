#Mon Pseudo-Code pour un jeu de Battleship fonctionnel.
#1. Cr√©er le tableau du premier joueur et deuxi√®me joueur.
#   -Grille des bateaux du premier joueur et sa grille de tir.
#   -Grille des bateaux du deuxi√®me joueur et sa grille de tir.
#2. Cr√©er les dimensions des cinq diff√©rents navires:
#   -Un Tourpilleur, dimension de 1x2 espaces.
#   -Deux Croiseur, dimensions de 1x3 espaces.
#   -Un Cuirass√©, dimension de 1x4 espaces.
#   -Un Porte-Avion, dimension de 1x5 cases.
#3. Faire Demander aux deux joueurs de tourner et placer les bateau dans la grille:
#   -Si le joueur place la pi√®ce et celle-ci d√©passe la grille ou est sur un autre bateau redemander de placer.
#   -Sinon Continuer √† placer les autres pi√®ces.
#4. Commencer la partie avec le premier joueur, demander qu'il entre une coordon√©e:
#   -Si le joueur touche un bateau ennemi, marquer une explosion sur la coordonn√©e.üí•
#   -Sinon marquer √† la coordonn√©e une vague. ‚¨ú
#5. Demander le deuxi√®me joueur de jouer et r√©p√©ter les conditions pr√©c√©dentes.
